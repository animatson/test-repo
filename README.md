# Testing gt.sh

 Aim of this script is to help in Alx task , to reduce repetion of writing same git 
 commands each time you are doing a new task.That is to say think about when you have a script which do some simple git activity automatically thats the idea.

## How it Works
  After finishing to answer a question Alx require you to push your solution to github ,now you can run this script and take care of you.
* What it does is it will run _git add ._ and _git commit -m ""_ all this automatically then you can push your work to github easily
* Thats what it does fir now but we are hoping to improve it much more in the future.
